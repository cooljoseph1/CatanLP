This is a simplified version of Settlers of Catan and an AI to play it.  The AI uses linear programming to determine the best moves to make.

Code structure:
`./game` -- This package contains what is needed to create a board and manage game assets
`./game_manager` -- This package contains the AI and how the AI plays games
`./genetic` -- This package contains (unused) methods to evolve a good AI using a genetic algorithm.
